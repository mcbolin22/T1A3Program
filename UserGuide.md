Aquaponics is a system that allows for the creation of an ecosystem that produces fish and plants for human consumption.

The methodology of Aquaponics is rooted in Permaculture; a way of living without adversely impacting the environment through harmful agricultural practices such as excessive use of fertilisers or land clearing for grazing animals.

Aquaponics is a combination of Hydroponics (growing plants in water) and Aquaculture (raising fish to eat). It combines the best of both systems without any wasteful practices such as dumping polluted water.

An Aquaponics system must have 4 key variables in balance in order to maintain a healthy ecosystem.

pH: the acid/base balance of the system.
Water temperature: ensuring a liveable temperatures for all inhabitants of the system.
Dissolved oxygen (DO): The amount of oxygen molecules available in the water.
Conductivity (EC): The electrical current measures the "salts" in the water, not actual salt but the reactivity of the nutrients available that also conduct electricity.

The program I have designed will track these variables, store them and give basic analysis of all previous data available to the program.
