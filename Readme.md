## Concept:
I'm thinking of doing my app on an aquaponics interface that will input water temperature, pH and nutrient levels. Give advice based on those outputs and store the data that has been produced for analysis ie averages. I can scale the complexity up or down in terms of app content to meet the rubric requirements.

3 features:
- Store data: utilise a csv file to add data to for each input variable
- Remove data: remove entries from the csv file
- Analyse data: generate analysis on the data contained in the csv file

## Implementation plan

1. Identify variables of an aquaponics system.
2. Create the above mentioned features handling the complexity of the variables gracefully.
3. Fault find and refine
4. Additional documentation
5. Presentation
6. Submit
